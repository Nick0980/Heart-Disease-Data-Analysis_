"""Summary of Heart Disease Data Analysis
Introduction
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and understanding the factors contributing to it is crucial for prevention and treatment. In this analysis, I examined a dataset containing various health metrics and demographic information related to heart disease. The goal was to identify significant patterns and relationships between these variables and the presence of heart disease. The analysis included data cleaning, visualization, statistical tests, and predictive modeling to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing heart disease.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset included features such as age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, ST segment slope, and the presence of heart disease.

I started by identifying and addressing potential outliers and missing values. For instance, any zero values in the RestingBP and Cholesterol columns were replaced with their respective medians to correct unrealistic entries. Categorical variables, such as gender and chest pain type, were converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding to prepare the data for analysis and modeling. Numerical features were standardized to ensure uniformity across different scales.

Data Visualization
Visualization helps in understanding the data distribution and relationships between variables. Key visualizations included:

Age Distribution: A histogram showed the age distribution of the participants, indicating the most common age groups affected by heart disease.

Heart Disease by Gender: A bar chart revealed the count of heart disease cases across genders, showing any potential gender disparities in heart disease prevalence.

Cholesterol Levels by Heart Disease: A box plot compared cholesterol levels between those with and without heart disease, highlighting any significant differences.

Max Heart Rate by Age: A scatter plot illustrated the relationship between age and maximum heart rate, with points colored by heart disease status, showing how heart rate varies with age and heart disease.

Chest Pain Type Distribution: A bar chart showed the distribution of different chest pain types, providing insights into the most common types among heart disease patients.

Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap displayed the correlations between numerical features, helping to identify which variables are most closely related.

Statistical Analysis
We performed a Chi-Squared test to determine if there was a significant association between categorical variables like gender and heart disease. The results indicated whether gender significantly affects heart disease prevalence.

Predictive Modeling
Using linear regression, I aimed to predict the maximum heart rate a person can achieve during physical exertion based on other features in the dataset. The model was trained on a portion of the data and tested on the remaining data to evaluate its performance. The key metrics for model evaluation included the mean squared error (MSE) and the RÂ² score, which indicate how well the model predicts and explains the variability in the maximum heart rate.

Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the factors contributing to heart disease. Key findings included:

Age and cholesterol levels are significant indicators of heart disease risk.
Gender differences in heart disease prevalence were observed, with males showing higher incidence rates.
Certain chest pain types were more commonly associated with heart disease.
Predictive modeling highlighted the potential for using health metrics to estimate heart function, which can aid in early detection and preventive measures.

This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of regular health check-ups and monitoring key health indicators to prevent and manage heart disease effectively. By understanding these relationships, healthcare providers can better tailor interventions and treatments to reduce the burden of heart disease.
