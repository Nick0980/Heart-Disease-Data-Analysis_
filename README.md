# Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis

Introduction In this project, I analyzed a dataset related to heart disease, aiming to uncover significant patterns and relationships between various health metrics and the presence of heart disease.My comprehensive analysis involved data cleaning, visualization, statistical testing, and predictive modeling to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing heart disease. Summary of Work Done Data Cleaning and Preparation: Addressed missing and zero values. One-hot encoded categorical variables. Standardized numerical features. Data Visualization: Histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to visualize distributions and relationships. Correlation heatmap to identify related variables. Statistical Analysis: Conducted Chi-Squared tests to explore associations between categorical variables. Predictive Modeling: Built and evaluated a linear regression model to predict maximum heart rate based on health metrics.
